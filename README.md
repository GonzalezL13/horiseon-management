# Code Refactor Starter Code

Our first HTML CSS Git Challenge was to teach us how to refactor a starter code and make it accessible.

The page is for a marketing agency called Horiseon. Horiseon offers different services. Those services include search engine optimization, online reputation management and social media marketing.

The challenge gave us a user story which tell us what they want.
It also gave us an acceptance criteria and a mock-up image that shows the web's appearance.

The acceptance criteria wanted us to include sematic HTML elements and structure the HTML elements to make it look cleaner. It also wanted alt attributes to make the page accessible.

Not only the HTML page needed to look clean but also the CSS page. We needed to clean it and make it more efficient, as well ass consolidate it. 

The Mock-Up of the landing page was
